# ChestXNet: Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project info
This project is part of AI in healthcare course on Udacity Platform. <br>
https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-healthcare-nanodegree--nd320 <br>

The goal of the project is to classify the X-ray scans as pneumonia postive or negative. Different Convolutional Neural Network architectures based on DenseNet121 pre-trained model are built, trained and evaluated.

## Dataset info
The dataset used in this project: 

NIH Chest X-ray Dataset comprised of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients.
The labels include 14 pathologies and were extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP) from radiological reports. <br>
